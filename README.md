The Language
------------------------------

Arturo is a modern programming language, vaguely inspired by various other ones - including but not limited to Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SDL, Tcl and Lisp.

The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles:

- Code is just a list of words and symbols
- Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context
- No reserved words or keyword - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none

```
print "Hello world!"

loop 1..10 'x [
    if? even? x -> print [x "is even"]
    else        -> print [x "is odd"]
]
```

Simple, isn't it?

The Compiler
------------------------------

The main compiler is implemented in Nim/C as a Bytecode interpreter / Stack-based VM and should run in most architectures.

The main goals are: performance, energy-efficiency and portability. (With that exact order)

How to Build & Install
------------------------------

### Manually

**Prerequisites:**

- Nim compiler
- A modern C compiler

**Build:**

    ./build.sh install

The compiler will be built and installed automatically in your `/usr/local/bin`. (So, make sure the folder is in your `$PATH` variable!)

That's it!

**Run script:**

    arturo <script>

**REPL/Interactive Console:**

    arturo
