The Language
------------------------------

Arturo is a modern programming language, vaguely inspired by various other ones - including but not limited to Ruby, Haskell, D, SDL, Tcl and Lisp.

The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles:

### Everything is a simple statement

There are no "special" language constructs. Everything you see is a statement in the form `ID <expression> <expression> <expression> ...`. An assignment is nothing but a labeled statement. `LABEL: <statement>`

### Code is data - and data is code

Arturo can be used both as a data-interchange format and a programming language. Basically all data structures are valid code and all code can be represented as a data structure. Think of it as SDL/Json/YAML/XML combined with the power of Lisp - but without the... sea of opening and closing parentheses.

### Each statement returns a value

Whether what you would consider a "function" or any other statement, it will return a value. If it's a block of code (see: *function*), the last statement's result will be return - unless specified otherwise.

### Uniform syntax

There are 3 types of statements. 
- Simple statements, that work as a function call in the form of `ID <expressions>`
- Expressions (Yes, `1+2` is also a valid statement)
- Labeled statements (see: assignments)  like `a: 2`

**Pro tip:** Do you want to use the result of a statement as part of an expression? Just enclose the function call in square brackets `[...]`	E.g.: `print [reverse @[1,2,3]]`. But don't be fooled: square brackets are nothing but a way to mark an expression's precedence, pretty much like what you'd do with a pair of parentheses.

Simple, isn't it?

The Compiler
------------------------------

The main compiler is implemented in ANSI C (99) as a Bytecode interpreter / Stack-based VM and should run in most architectures.

The main goals are: performance, energy-efficiency and portability. (With that exact order)

How to Build & Install
------------------------------

### Manually

**Prerequisites:**

- Flex & Bison
- GMP library
- A modern C compiler

**Build:**

	sudo ./build.sh

The compiler will be built and installed automatically in your `/usr/local/bin`. (So, make sure the folder is in your `$PATH` variable!)

That's it!

**Run script:**

	arturo <script>

**Compile script:**

	arturo -c <script>

**Execute precompiled object file:**

	arturo -x <object file>

**REPL:**

	arturo
