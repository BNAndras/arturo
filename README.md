The Language 
------------------------------

Arturo is an independently-developed, modern programming language, vaguely related to various other ones - including but not limited to: Logo, Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SmallTalk, Tcl, and Lisp.

The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles:

- Code is just a list of words, symbols and literal values
- Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context
- No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none

```red
factorial: function [n][
	if? n > 0 -> n * factorial n-1
	else 	  -> 1
] 

loop 1..19 [x]->
	print ["Factorial of" x "=" factorial x]
```

Simple, isn't it?

> üí°  For more - working - examples, just have a look into the /examples folder

Documentation
------------------------------

For more information about the language and access to the library reference, please visit the official [Arturo Programming Language documentation](https://arturo-lang.io/documentation/) website.

Installation
------------------------------

### Pre-built binaries

Arturo comes with its own pre-built binaries (for practically, all OSes). All you have to do is download one of them and run it - that's it!

#### [‚¨áÔ∏è Download Arturo now](https://arturo-lang.io/#download)

*For being as up-to-date as possible, head over to the [Nightlies repo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/nightly/releases) and simply download the latest release.

### The alternative way

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.arturo-lang.io | sh
```

For Unix/Mac, you may also copy-paste the code above in your terminal and Arturo's most recent stable version will be automatically installed.
To get the most recent (nightly) build, just use: `curl -sSL https://get.arturo-lang.io/latest | sh`

*If there is any issue with the installation, just let me know and I'll try to fix it. In any case, it would be safer to try one of the pre-built binaries.*

### Manually

In order to build Arturo manually, you may have a look here:

### Other methods

#### Docker

Although it won't cut it, if what you need is the real-deal compiler for everyday use, if you just need a taste of it, the Docker image will absolutely do.

Just use the existing docker image:

	docker run -it arturolang/arturo

or (to run a specific local script):

	docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home arturolang/arturo <yourscript.art>

#### Homebrew

If you are on macOS, you can easily install Arturo using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as well - although I cannot guarantee it will be the latest version:

```bash
brew install arturo
```

Contributing
------------------------------

Please read [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details and the process for submitting pull requests.

**In a few words:** all contributions (even if they are just ideas or suggestions) are 100% welcome!

### Roadmap

The list of things to fix and/or add could be endless. But here is one, a bit prioritized (if you think you can help, you know the way ;-):

- [X] Add support for big number handling (via GMP)
- [ ] Enrich the system library
   - [X] Add built-in support for Databases (Sqlite, etc)
   - [X] Implement HTML module
   - [ ] Add more Server-related features
   - [ ] Implement LaTeX generation module
   - [ ] Add custom grammar parser functionality
- [ ] Optimize and refine the bytecode
- [ ] Improve VM performance
- [X] Add the option of saving intermediate bytecode
- [X] Add support for a package manager
- [ ] Add UI support (via libui? via webview? both?)
- [ ] Explore different uses of Arturo's dialecting capabilities (DSLs)
- [ ] Implement a basic Arturo compiler (written in Arturo :blush:)
- [ ] Go full self-hosted (that's an ambitious one, I know...)

### Project structure

To get an initial idea of the project, here's a brief guide to where is what:

| Location | Description |
|---|---|
| `bin/` | The destination of the final binary after compilation |
| `examples/` | A list of working examples in Arturo |
| `src/` | The main source folder |
| `src/extras/` | 3rd party open-source code used by Arturo |
| `src/helpers/` | Useful helper methods grouped by category and used mostly by library functions |
| `src/library/` | The Arturo standard library functions, grouped by category |
| `src/system/` | Components of the Arturo binary, written in Arturo (the REPL, the packager, etc) |
| `src/vm/` | The Virtual Machine |
| `src/vm/bytecode.nim` | A list of all the VM bytecodes along with their description |
| `src/vm/env.nim` | VM Environment handling (paths, etc) |
| `src/vm/eval.nim` | The evaluator: where the parse tree turns into bytecode instructions |
| `src/vm/exec.nim` | The most important VM module, where the main loop is triggered |
| `src/vm/parse.nim` | The main lexer/parser: turning the initial input into a parse tree, of words, symbols and values |
| `src/vm/stack.nim` | Manipulation code for the different stacks used by the VM |
| `src/vm/value.nim` | The main Value object for our Virtual Machine along with numerous overloads, from initialization methods to printing and basic arithmetic |
| `src/arturo.nim` | The main entry; where all the magic begins |
| `tests/` | Different unit tests |
| `tools/` | Various tools, documentation generation, etc |
| `version/` | Main version & build numbers |

### The Compiler

The main compiler is implemented in Nim/C as a Bytecode interpreter / Stack-based VM and should run in most architectures.

The main goals are: expressiveness, brevity, performance and portability. (With that exact order)

Community
------------------------------

In case you want to ask a question, suggest an idea, or practically anything related to Arturo - feel free! Everything and everyone is welcome.

For that, the most convenient place for me would be the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/issues) page.

For questions, quick ideas, and discussing generally the language, there is also a [dedicated Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YdVK2CB) for all things Arturo and a [Gitter community](https://gitter.im/arturo-lang/community) -- which I will hopefully get familiar with at some point (lol).

FAQ
------------------------------

**What's in a name?**

In case you're wondering why I went for a programming language with a... Spanish male name, let me shed some light: Arturo was the name of my little pet [Emperor Scorpion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_scorpion) - hence the logo -, or *Pandinus Imperator*, who passed away in early 2020. 

Despite being seemingly intimidating - as most scorpions do to those who don't know about the species - he was a very quiet, totally docile, easy-going and noble creature. 

So, the name is a subtle hommage to him; and also a hint as to what this programming language aspires to be.
