The Language 
------------------------------

Arturo is an independently-developed, modern programming language, vaguely related to various other ones - including but not limited to Logo, Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SmallTalk, Tcl, and Lisp.

The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles:

- Code is just a list of words and symbols
- Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context
- No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none

```red
factorial: function [n][
	if? n > 0 -> n * factorial n-1
	else 	  -> 1
] 

loop 1..19 [x]->
	print ["Factorial of" x "=" factorial x]
```

Simple, isn't it?

> ðŸ’¡  For more - working - examples, just have a look into the /examples folder

Trying it out
------------------------------

### Homebrew

On OSX, you can easily install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as well:

```bash
brew install arturo
```

### Manually

> ðŸ’¡  Arturo should compile practically everywhere: Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS - [even Android](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/issues/65#issuecomment-770723447). If you encounter an issue, or your OS is not supported, drop me a line!

#### Prerequisites

* [Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/)<br> 
  if you don't have it installed, all it'll take is 2 simple commands:

      curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh
      choosenim stable
* Dependencies (for Linux):
   - gtk+-3.0 *(\* needed only for non-mini builds)*
   - webkit2gtk-4.0 *(\* needed only for non-mini builds)*
   - libgmp-dev

#### Build & Install Arturo

**a) via the main build script** (*recommended)

    ./install

The binary will be automatically installed in `~/.arturo/bin`

> ðŸ’¡  For *mini* builds - that is without GTK dependencies and a tiny bit less library functions - just install via `./install mini`


**b) via Nimble**

    nimble install -Y

The compiler will be built and installed automatically in your `$HOME/.nimble/bin`. (So, make sure the folder is in your `$PATH` variable!)

### Docker

Just use the existing docker image:

	docker run -it arturolang/arturo

or (to run a specific local script):

	docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home arturolang/arturo <yourscript.art>
	
### Online

Editors & IDEs
------------------------------

If you prefer to use some specific editors, check which one is already supported (if your preferred editor is not yet supported, just drop me a line - or help me include it):

- **Visual Studio Code**:   
https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-vscode-package

- **SublimeText**:    
https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-sublimetext-package

- **Vim / Neovim**: (Thanks @xigoi :-))

Contributing
------------------------------

Please read [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details and the process for submitting pull requests.

**In a few words:** all contributions (even if they are just ideas or suggestions) are 100% welcome!

### Roadmap

The list of things to fix and/or add could be endless. But here is one, a bit prioritized (if you think you can help, you know the way ;-):

- [X] Add support for big number handling (via GMP)
- [ ] Enrich the system library
   - [X] Add built-in support for Databases (Sqlite, etc)
   - [X] Implement HTML module
   - [ ] Add more Server-related features
   - [ ] Implement LaTeX generation module
   - [ ] Add custom grammar parser functionality
- [ ] Optimize and refine the bytecode
- [ ] Improve VM performance
- [X] Add the option of saving intermediate bytecode
- [X] Add support for a package manager
- [ ] Add UI support (via libui? via webview? both?)
- [ ] Explore different uses of Arturo's dialecting capabilities (SDLs)
- [ ] Implement a basic Arturo compiler (written in Arturo :blush:)
- [ ] Go full self-hosted (that's an ambitious one, I know...)

### Project structure

To get an initial idea of the project, here's a brief guide to where is what:

| Location | Description |
|---|---|
| `bin/` | The destination of the final binary after compilation |
| `examples/` | A list of working examples in Arturo |
| `src/` | The main source folder |
| `src/extras/` | 3rd party open-source code used by Arturo |
| `src/helpers/` | Useful helper methods grouped by category and used mostly by library functions |
| `src/library/` | The Arturo standard library functions, grouped by category |
| `src/system/` | Components of the Arturo binary, written in Arturo (the REPL, the packager, etc) |
| `src/vm/` | The Virtual Machine |
| `src/vm/bytecode.nim` | A list of all the VM bytecodes along with their description |
| `src/vm/env.nim` | VM Environment handling (paths, etc) |
| `src/vm/eval.nim` | The evaluator: where the parse tree turns into bytecode instructions |
| `src/vm/exec.nim` | The most important VM module, where the main loop is triggered |
| `src/vm/parse.nim` | The main lexer/parser: turning the initial input into a parse tree, of words, symbols and values |
| `src/vm/stack.nim` | Manipulation code for the different stacks used by the VM |
| `src/vm/value.nim` | The main Value object for our Virtual Machine along with numerous overloads, from initialization methods to printing and basic arithmetic |
| `src/arturo.nim` | The main entry; where all the magic begins |
| `tests/` | Different unit tests |
| `tools/` | Various tools, documentation generation, etc |
| `version/` | Main version & build numbers |

### The Compiler

The main compiler is implemented in Nim/C as a Bytecode interpreter / Stack-based VM and should run in most architectures.

The main goals are: expressiveness, brevity, performance and portability. (With that exact order)

Community
------------------------------

In case you want to ask a question, suggest an idea, or practically anything related to Arturo - feel free! Everything and everyone is welcome.

For that, the most convenient place for me would be the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/issues) page.

For questions, quick ideas, and discussing generally the language, there is also a [dedicated Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YdVK2CB) for all things Arturo and a [Gitter community](https://gitter.im/arturo-lang/community) -- which I will hopefully get familiar with at some point (lol).
