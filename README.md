The Language 
------------------------------

Arturo is a modern programming language, vaguely inspired by various other ones - including but not limited to Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SmallTalk, Tcl and Lisp.

The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles:

- Code is just a list of words and symbols
- Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context
- No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none

```
print "Hello world!"

loop 1..10 'x [
    if? even? x -> print [x "is even"]
    else        -> print [x "is odd"]
]
```

Simple, isn't it?

> :information_source:   For more - working - examples, just have a look into the /examples folder

The Compiler
------------------------------

The main compiler is implemented in Nim/C as a Bytecode interpreter / Stack-based VM and should run in most architectures.

The main goals are: performance, energy-efficiency and portability. (With that exact order)

Trying it out
------------------------------

### Online

@ [arturo-lang.io](http://arturo-lang.io/)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arturo-lang/arturo/master/demo.gif"/>

### Manually

> :information_source:   Arturo should be able to compiler on practically everything: Windows, Linux, Mac OS. In case you encounter any issue, or your OS is not supported, drop me a line!

#### Prerequisites

* [Nim compiler](https://nim-lang.org/)<br> 
  if you don't have it installed, all it'll take is 2 simple commands:

      curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh
      choosenim install devel

#### Build & Install Arturo
	
    ./build.sh install

The compiler will be built and installed automatically in your `/usr/local/bin`. (So, make sure the folder is in your `$PATH` variable!)

That's it!

### Docker

Just use the existing docker image:

	docker run -it fingidor/arturo-repl


Using the command line
------------------------------

#### Run a script

    arturo <script>

#### Interactive console / REPL

    arturo
    
Editors & IDEs
------------------------------

If you prefer to use some specific editors, check which one are already supported (if your preferred editor is not yet supported, just drop me a line - or help me include it):

- **SublimeText**:
