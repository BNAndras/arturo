The Language 
------------------------------

Arturo is an independently-developed, modern programming language, vaguely related to various other ones - including but not limited to: Logo, Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SmallTalk, Tcl, and Lisp.

The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles:

- Code is just a list of words, symbols and literal values
- Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context
- No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none

```red
factorial: function [n][
	if? n > 0 -> n * factorial n-1
	else 	  -> 1
] 

loop 1..19 [x]->
	print ["Factorial of" x "=" factorial x]
```

Simple, isn't it?

Installation
------------------------------

### Pre-built binaries

Arturo comes with its own pre-built binaries - for, practically, all OSes - so, technically, it doesn't require any "installation". All you have to do is download one of them and run it - that's it!

#### [‚¨áÔ∏è Download Arturo](https://arturo-lang.io/#download)

*Wanna be as up-to-date as possible? Head over to the [Nightlies repo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/nightly/releases) and simply download the latest release!

### The alternative way

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.arturo-lang.io | sh
```

For Unix/Mac, you may also copy-paste the code above in your terminal and Arturo's most recent stable version will be automatically installed.
To get the most recent (nightly) build, just use: `curl -sSL https://get.arturo-lang.io/latest | sh`

*If there is any issue with the installation, just let me know and I'll try to fix it. In any case, it would be safer to try one of the pre-built binaries.*

### Manually

In order to build Arturo manually, you may have a look here at the [instructions here](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/wiki/Building-Arturo).

### Other methods

#### Docker

Although it won't cut it, if what you need is the real-deal compiler for everyday use, if you just need a taste of it, the Docker image will absolutely do.

Just use the existing docker image:

	docker run -it arturolang/arturo

or (to run a specific local script):

	docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home arturolang/arturo <yourscript.art>

#### Homebrew

If you are on macOS, you can easily install Arturo using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as well - although I cannot guarantee it will be the latest version:

```bash
brew install arturo
```

FAQ
------------------------------

**What's in a name?**

In case you're wondering why I went for a programming language with a... Spanish male name, let me shed some light: Arturo was the name of my little pet [Emperor Scorpion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_scorpion) - hence the logo -, or *Pandinus Imperator*, who passed away in early 2020. 

Despite being seemingly intimidating - as most scorpions do to those who don't know about the species - he was a very quiet, totally docile, easy-going and noble creature. 

So, the name is a subtle hommage to him; and also a hint as to what this programming language aspires to be.
