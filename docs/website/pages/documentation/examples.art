If you're more of a hands-on coder (trust me, I do understand you) and want to see the language in action, here are more than enough examples (%EXAMPLES_COUNT% in total! - most of them, based on Rosetta Code tasks), to instantly try and test in the online playground:
<div class="columns">
    <div class="column is-6">
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                %EXAMPLES_1%
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="column is-6">
        <div class="content">
            <ul>
                %EXAMPLES_2%
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
